# Emacs-Setup
Emacs configuration file


This is my very first attempt at creating at what seems to be a startup
configuration file (.emacs) for Emacs.
A lot of useful stuff is taken from Casey Muratori's config,
so a Big Thank you Casey, for sharing this with the community.

This, without a doubt, will be updated in the future.
